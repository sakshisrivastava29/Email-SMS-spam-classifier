Sms-spam-detector is a machine learning model built using Natural Language Processing , TfidfVectorizer and CountVectorizer.The projext is built from scratch ,in which I have performed Data Cleaning ,EDA,Data preprocessing ,creating the model,training and tesing the model and finally deploment . I have recently build this project to upgrade my skills in Natural language processing toolkit, various machine learning algorithms, I had done a lot of Exploratory Data Analysis using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries. While developing this project I have upskilled myself in making a machine learning model after going through various stage of development
